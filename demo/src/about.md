These are [boops](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/boop)!

This library provides a simple way of creating *Boop* effects in vanilla JavaScript using a fork of [*wobble*](https://github.com/tommy-mitchell/wobble), a tiny library for simulating spring physics.

The effects on this page are an exaggerated demo of what can be created â€“ in practice, they're far better as subtle effects, like the chevron indicator next to the accordion button above. Open the example modal below to see some simpler examples.
